# AVL Tree Implementation in Python

This project is a simple implementation of an **AVL Tree**, which is a type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST). Every time you insert or delete a node, the tree makes sure it's still balanced.

This code was written step-by-step with clear explanations, especially for beginners who are just starting to learn how trees work in programming.

##  What Is an AVL Tree?

An AVL Tree is a **Binary Search Tree** that keeps itself balanced. That means the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node will never be more than 1.

When an insertion or deletion makes the tree unbalanced, it automatically performs rotations to fix the imbalance.
